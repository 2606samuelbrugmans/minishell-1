init_env.c : l 54-55

see if we look for the extra check I left in comment in checker.c => first_check. I can't manage to trigger it

change message in family.c line 28

left printf in free'...'.c in comments




got the program to exit cleanly when no command is passed
don't expand variable before tokenising please it's important !!!!!

- left your comments in SAM_signals.c out of the fct for norminette, see if you still need it or not
- in SAM_signals also, global var must start with g_ for the norminette but when doing so, I can't compile... Do you know what the issue is ?

- in tiny.c, should we also care about the tab ? like '	'

- echo < MAKEFILE doesn't print correctly the error ==> corrected behavior by putting echo in builtin_parents... Can I ?

- >file1 segfault..... same with <file1 bc minish->instr[i].exec is not set during tok_into_tab, so when trying to dereferencing it causes crash
