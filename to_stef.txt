this is the end warn me if you want to change anything also tell me if there's something wrong with signals and what
i'd advise you to do tests and show me the result somewhere with a tldr here as well for stuff that don't work the way they're supposed to
don't forget to compare with bash 
we will do our first real correction as early as possible this week
i have faith the end of this is near...


ps i did revert a lot of things but it's based on comparison with bash on my laptop
ps2 sorry for the global variable i'll look into it tmrw a little but i think we can have it iirc
